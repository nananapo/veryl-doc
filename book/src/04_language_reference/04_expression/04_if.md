# If

Conditional expression using `if` can be used.
The section which represents condition is placed after `if` keyword,
and `()` is not required surrounding it.
`else` is mandatory because if expression always have to be evaluated to value.

```veryl,playground
module ModuleA {
    var a: logic<10>;
    var b: logic<10>;

    assign b = if a == 0 {
        1
    } else if a >: 1 {
        2
    } else {
        3
    };
}
```
