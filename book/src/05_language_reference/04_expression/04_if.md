# If

Conditional expression using `if` can be used.
The section which represents condition is placed after `if` keyword,
and `()` is not required surrounding it.
An expression at true condition is placed after `?`, and an expression at false condition is placed after `:`.

```veryl,playground
module ModuleA {
    let a: logic<10> = 1;
    var b: logic<10>;

    assign b = if a == 0 ? 1 : if a >: 1 ? 2 : 3;
}
```
